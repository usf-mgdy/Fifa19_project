# Communicate-Data-Findings
this dataset is not included in as one of the provided by udacity i simply saw that it's a good data set and will get good visuals from it
## invastegation overview:
* The data needed to be cleaned espcially the Value and Wage parts to extract the values correctly
* International reputation palyes a huge role in the data
* Value and Wage columns most of the time have +ve relation with other columns
### In Univariate exploration i found:
**Clubs willing to pay above average Wage:**

* 1-Real Madrid
* 2-FC Barcelona
* 3-Manchester City
* 4-Manchester United
* 5-Juventus
* 6-Chelsea
* 7-Liverpool
* 8-Tottenham Hotspur

* 4-Juventus
* 5-FC Bayern München
* 6-Atlético Madrid 	
* 7-Paris Saint-Germain
* 8-Tottenham Hotspur
* 9-Chelsea
* 10-Manchester United
### In Bivariate exploration i found:

**Reputation and Age**

reputation is from 1 to 5 and 5 is the highest majorty of players as we see have one and only few got 5, I also noticed that as the reputation score increses the box plot is not as spread which and it shrinks on both sides wich means that players need to be not only have crazy status but also have experience and looks like ages between 25 to 35 is where players have 4 and 5 rep points because usally this is the prime years of a player

**Potential and Reputation**

as the potential of players increase rep shrinks high rep like 4 and 5 is only for palyers in range 80's to 90's and there are not outliers but in the ranks 1 and 2  there is ton of outliers from that visual it seems that rep depends on many things potential is one of them but it's not a main reason because there is a lot of rank 2 players in the range of rank 4 and 5

### In multivariate exploration i found:

**Relation between Overall, Wage and International Reputation**

This plot shows us that players with high overall not only gain more Wage as a player it also gives the player high international reputation of course its not the only factor for high Rep but it's one of the reasons
